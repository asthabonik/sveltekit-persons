Features
SvelteKit Framework: Leverages SvelteKit for fast, server-rendered, and static site generation.

Dynamic Routing: Demonstrates dynamic routing for blog posts and other content.

API Integration: Fetches data from external APIs to display dynamic content.

Responsive Design: Ensures the application is mobile-friendly and works across devices.

Markdown Support: Uses markdown files for content management (e.g., blog posts).
